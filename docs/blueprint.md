# **App Name**: ScanUnion

## Core Features:

- Event Management: Allow admins to create, edit, and archive events, set date, time, location, and description. Also, enable or disable scanning for an event.
- User Management: Enable admins to add new scanning users with a name and a unique 4-6 digit PIN, and view user scanning history.
- Scanning Interface: Provide scanning users with an interface displaying event tiles with basic stats and a scan page with live personal scan count and feedback on scans.
- Admin Dashboard: Generate and show live event metrics such as total scanned, per-user scan counts, and per-hour scan trends in graph format.
- Reporting with AI: Provide event attendance reports and generate summaries that will include number of attendees, hourly attendance breakdown, peak hour, per-scanner performance, duplicate scans, and time-stamped logs; exportable as CSV, Excel, and PDF; using AI as a tool to analyze user patterns to find correlations. 
- Offline Mode: If internet connection drops, store scans locally and sync later.
- Security & Authentication: Secure scanning user login with PIN-based dashboard, and admin login with username/password with 2FA.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a moderate blue (#6699CC), reminiscent of school colors and conveying trust and reliability, given that the app deals with access control. The choice also avoids the cliche of using 'school bus yellow'.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E5EA) to provide a neutral, uncluttered backdrop that ensures legibility and doesn't distract from the essential data.
- Accent color: Use a muted green (#8FBC8F) to provide visual contrast, highlight important actions/metrics in the UI (particularly successful scans), and give an overall sense of reassurance.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet approachable and easily readable style.
- Use consistent and clear icons from a simple, modern set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent events, users, and actions.
- Employ a tile-based layout for event selection, particularly on the scanning user interface, for easy selection.
- Provide subtle animations and transitions (e.g., a quick zoom/pulse effect) when scans are successful to give visual feedback without being distracting.
